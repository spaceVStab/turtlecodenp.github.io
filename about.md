<h2 class="go-home">Mission</h2>
<p class="go-home">
	TurtleCode is on a path to make innovators for the future of Nepal. Coding is regarded as one of the most essential skill in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. We believe on planting and nurturing the seed of coding in early ages helps children to learn fast with increased cognitive ability. Although school curriculum do include "Computer Science" as one of the courses but they are not taught on how to write computer software. We provide a fun and interactive environment for your child to maximize their creativity and logical thinking. If your child is smart enough to play games you don't understand, they sure are smart enough to build one too.
